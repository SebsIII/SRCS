# SRCS - Satellite Receiver Control Station

The STM32F401RE based **Satellite RF signals reciver control station** for NOAA satellites to maximize receiving quality of weather satellites broadcasts to get local satellite's views images.
<h6>I definitely need a better name, By Sebs_</h6>

## Description
The control station is made primarely of 2 modules:
- The motorized antenna module : The **core** of the control station and the actual receiver, it's made of a [dipole antenna](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dipole_antenna) tuned at NOAA's frequencies in horizontal polarization connected to a [28BYJ-48](https://www.mouser.com/datasheet/2/758/stepd-01-data-sheet-1143075.pdf?srsltid=AfmBOor0JeeT5X12a_oRtEgDTfQxDhepoXjEc7EOESq1vM4Kv5rxR0na) stepper motor.
- The weather data module - The secondary part of the SRCS that gets weather data that will be analyzed by the [MCU](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microcontroller).

## üõ∞Ô∏è NOAA's satellites

The NOAA ([National Oceanic Atmospheric Atministration](https://www.noaa.gov/)) is a US  agecy that studies how weather changes our planet, both on it's surface and under the seas. <br>
Other then other missions, it made a [campaign of polar-orbiting, non-geosynchronous, environmental satellites](https://www.n2yo.com/satellites/?c=4), from NOAA-1 up to NOAA-21. <br>
From all of those, the best and easiest one to receive are the NOAA-15, NOAA-18 and NOAA-19, which continously trasmit weather data with [APT](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Automatic_picture_transmission) techniques on their downlink frequency as a "sound". <br>
Those "sounds" will eventually need to be converted into .WAV files and thed decoded with an apt-decoder, in our case we'll use [noaa-apt](https://noaa-apt.mbernardi.com.ar/)

## 1st Module: The motorized antenna

> [!WARNING]
> Regular linear dipole or V dipole?
> eventually update 

The first module is made of two parts, the **dipole antenna** and the **motorized support**:
- The dipole antenna is the effective receiver of the SRCS, it's a horizontally polazied, omnidirectional, **Vee dipole antenna** tuned at 137.5 MHz (average downlink     frequency of NOAA-15,18,19 *). <br>
  The antenna output will eventually be connected to a 50 ohm [RG58 coaxial cable](https://www.farnell.com/datasheets/2095749.pdf) that will transfer the output signal from the antenna to the [RTL-SDR](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software-defined_radio) or the general receiver that will, later on, analyze the signal and convert it in an image. <br>
  (See the [antenna](https://github.com/SebsIII/SRCS/blob/main/datasheets/antenna-info.md) MD file for more info)
  
- The motorized support is where the antenna is mounted and the part that will, indeed, **rotate** the antenna itself while the satellite is passing near the SRCS 
  to ensure the highest quality receiving of data reception of the dipole. <br>
  Its mainly composed of a **28BYJ-48 stepper motor**, a **gear box** to reduce the motor speed and to reduce the minimum step angle to get the smallest angle of 
  rotation from the motor output chassis, an [AS5600 magnetic encoder](https://files.seeedstudio.com/wiki/Grove-12-bit-Magnetic-Rotary-Position-Sensor-AS5600/res/Magnetic%20Rotary%20Position%20Sensor%20AS5600%20Datasheet.pdf) the **antenna mount** and the **BFT wall-connector output** from the antenna
  
<h6>* The bandwidth of the 137.5 MHz dipole antenna offers enough bandwindth to get all the 137.1, 137.620 and 137.9125 MHz frequencies </h6>
